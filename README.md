# Lightweight CNN + MLP for Leaf Classification

This project implements lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and multimodal fusion models for leaf species classification using the public **Leaf Dataset** (Silva et al., 2014). 

<br><br>

The dataset contains both:
- **Holographic grayscale images** (from BW directory) for structural patterns,
- **Fluorescence-based numerical features** (from `leaf.csv`) for biochemical descriptors.

<br>

All models are implemented using **TensorFlow** (As in the original paper) and trained/evaluated with accuracy and F1-score metrics.
